# itc250-p3-foodtruck



For our second group project we'll be  building a PHP application that allows a user to select items from a menu as if they are ordering from a food truck.

Classes Required, Data Driven By Objects: Data for the food truck items must be stored in objects. Important Requirement - Changing the objects and their properties must change the form and totals in the formhandler.  Do not build your form and formhandler statically, meaning so that it always and only supports one set of values!  Here's the example code we created in class, the Item class and objects (Links to an external site.)

The application must:

Allow items to be chosen from a form
Display the items chosen and add and display the total cost
Allow more than one of each item to be purchased
Each item must have at least a name, description and price
Disallow incorrect data and provide feedback, for example, when a user inputs a string, the data is not processed and the user is informed of the mistake.
Be built as nearly as possible to PSR-1 (Links to an external site.) and PSR-2 (Links to an external site.) standards
Project Document: Besides a working application, you must also show your program design pieces visually on a project document shared by your team and also with my email: kyrrahnork@gmail.com

Visual Elements Required: Your program design document should identify an IPO chart and a flowchart of how the application will operate and process data.

Work Log: Your project document must include notes from each team member at the bottom of the document identifying what was done, how long it took each and every time work is done on the project.  Here's an example notation:

4/26/2016: (Bill) Updated P2 Food Truck assignment to include updated requirements.  (.5 hours)

Each member should place the most recent work at the top, so that each work log entry descends in chronological order.

Standards - The app should be built as nearly as possible to PSR-1 and PSR-2 standards

Source Code via Repo Required: Please show your source code by placing your code in a repo and providing a link to your repo.  If you wish to use a private repo, you can use my GitHub username and share it with me: kyrrahnork

Roles & Responsibilities

Since this is a larger project, consider splitting up the responsibilities so everyone is productive.

Roles: Be sure the work to be done is split up as evenly as possible, with each member taking on multiple roles as required.  

New Role, Tech Lead: In this project, we'll start with a lead developer as a role in which that person will assist others in coding and not do much coding themselves.  Your goal will be to support the team and help troubleshoot, but help others develop skills and confidence.  Here's a place to start for advice in this regard:

A tech lead could also do code reviews or help with repo management as well.

Other roles should fulfill duties such as:

Data Design/Object handling: Build the objects and working with the data 
Visual Design: build the HTML page mockups and partial repeating HTML fragments
Research: Research resources & techniques necessary.  
Documentation: Making sure the code is documented properly and completely
Code Review: Check for standards compliance and consistent documentation
Repo Management: Now that we're branching code, someone should manage merges and conflicts
Testing: Testing the code to be sure it succeeds in many conditions, including upon input of bad data
Project Management: Making sure all items are completed on time, and no important pieces are missing
Application Design: Building the fundamental programmatic pages
Page/Data Architecture: Determine the  pages & data required for the app 
Early/Middle/Late Roles: The roles identified above can be distributed so work is done effectively at every stage of the project.  We'll define early/middle/late as the following:

Early: Before code has been written.  Research, visual and data design, experimentation, goal setting and algorithms
Middle: Everyone should be coding - hopefully in different areas of the app
Late: Developers can code review each other's work, and perform testing and documentation
Example Division of Work: Below we'll take a 3 person team and identify some roles designed to occupy each team member during early, late & middle stages of a project:

Member #1: Early - Visual Design, Project Management Late - Testing, Documentation
Member #2: Early - Data design, App Design Late - Project Management, Code Review
Member #3: Early - Research, Repo Management Late - Code Review, Repo Management
All members code in middle stage: The middle stage is not mentioned above as all team members would be coding at that stage.

Due date is midnight on group projects: To allow use of class time, all group projects have a soft due date, and the time on the submission is midnight.

Submissions: All team members must submit a shareable link to their Project Document. The project Document will have links to the repo and to the Food Truck page.

Extra Credit: You can gain up to 10 points extra credit for building an application that properly includes all subtotals and sales tax to the purchase!
